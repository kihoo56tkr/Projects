# Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model to classify brain tumors in MRI images. It was part of a team-based project where various approaches were explored, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, and evaluation. My primary contribution to this project was in the development and implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate tumor detection.

Project Overview
The goal of the project was to create an automated system that can analyze MRI scans and detect the presence of brain tumors. The project involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation of the modelâ€™s accuracy. We used deep learning techniques to classify images as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free.

My Contribution:
- CNN Development: I was responsible for developing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies MRI images into two categories: "Tumor" and "No Tumor."
- Model Training: I handled the training of the CNN on a dataset of MRI images, ensuring effective learning through optimization and validation techniques.
- Preprocessing and Augmentation: I assisted in preprocessing MRI images, including resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them to improve the CNN's generalization ability.

Model Architecture
The CNN architecture is designed to learn from the MRI images, using the following layers:
- Convolutional Layers: To extract features from the images.
- Max-Pooling Layers: To reduce dimensionality while preserving important features.
- Fully Connected Layers: To classify the images based on learned features.
- Output Layer: A softmax layer to output the final classification as either "Tumor" or "No Tumor."

Future Work
- Improved Architecture: Exploring other advanced models like ResNet or VGG for better accuracy.
- Real-time Detection: Implementing the trained model to classify MRI scans in real-time for medical applications.

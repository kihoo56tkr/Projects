# Bike Rental Analysis Project

This project analyzes bike rental data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends using statistical methods and linear regression modeling.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Course: ST1131: Introduction to Statistics and Statistical Computing
- Semester: AY23/24 Semester 2
- Score: 100/100

The analysis explores the relationship between bike rental counts and factors such as weather, season, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- Temperature and season significantly impact daily bike rental counts.
- Interaction between season and temperature improves model accuracy.
- Final model assumptions (normality, constant variance, no influential outliers) are satisfied.

ðŸ“š Conclusion
A robust linear regression model was developed to predict daily bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal factors.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- R Programming
- Statistical Modeling
- Data Visualization

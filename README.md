# TKR's Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of my personal and academic projects, showcasing my work in areas such as machine learning and statistical computing. Each project is organized in a separate branch, making it easy to explore my different works.

Projects
The following projects are available as separate branches in this repository:

1. Brain Tumor Detection
  Branch: Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-and-Impact
  Description: This project focuses on detecting brain tumors in MRI scans using different deep learning methods. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  My Contribution: I was responsible for the development and implementation of the CNN for image classification.
  Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib.

2. Bike Rental Prediction
  Branch: Statistics-and-Statistical-Computing
  Description: This individual project focuses on analyzing and building predictive models for bike rental data to forecast the daily count of rental bikes. The dataset contains features like temperature, humidity, season, weather conditions, and working day status, and the goal is to build a regression model to predict the number of bike rentals.
  My Contribution: I handled the data exploration, transformation of response variables, and built multiple regression models to predict the daily bike rental count. I also conducted outlier removal, feature selection, and model evaluation to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
  Technologies: R, lm (linear regression)

3. Customer-Server Simulation
  Branch: Simulation-and-Modeling
  Description: This project simulates a customer-server system, tracking customers as they arrive, wait, get served, leave, or complete their interactions. The simulation handles dynamic service times and calculates statistics such as average waiting time, the number of customers served, and the number of customers who left.
  My Contribution: I implemented the core logic of the event-based simulation, designed the state-based system for event processing, and handled the computation of simulation statistics.
  Technologies: Java, functional programming constructs.

4. Email Reminder Automation
Branch: email-reminder-automation
Description: This project automates the process of sending reminder emails related to quarterly data updates. It calculates important dates such as deadlines for updates, integrates with Outlook, and sends personalized emails with a link for data updates.
My Contribution: I handled the integration with Outlook, developed the date calculations logic for determining deadlines, and created the email templates. The automation ensures that emails are only sent once per quarter.
Technologies: Python, win32com.client, openpyxl

5. Report Generation Automation Branch: report-generation-automation
Description: This project automates the process of generating and updating reports based on quarterly data, integrating calculations such as application processing counts, service standards compliance, and time-based metrics. It tracks data entries and updates reports accordingly, ensuring accurate and timely reporting.
My Contribution: I developed the logic for date handling, sheet duplication, count tracking, and service standard calculations. Additionally, I integrated Excel operations to process and update reports efficiently using the openpyxl library.
Technologies: Python, openpyxl

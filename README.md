# TKR's Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of my personal and academic projects, showcasing my work in areas such as machine learning and statistical computing. Each project is organized in a separate branch, making it easy to explore my different works.

## Projects
The following projects are available as separate branches in this repository:

### Brain Tumor Detection
Branch: Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-and-Impact
Description: This project focuses on detecting brain tumors in MRI scans using different deep learning methods. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
My Contribution: I was responsible for the development and implementation of the CNN for image classification.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib.

### Bike Rental Prediction
Branch: Statistics-and-Statistical-Computing
Description: This individual project focuses on analyzing and building predictive models for bike rental data to forecast the daily count of rental bikes.
My Contribution: I handled data exploration, response variable transformation, model building, outlier removal, and performance evaluation.
Technologies: R, linear regression.

### Customer-Server Simulation
Branch: Simulation-and-Modeling
Description: Simulates a customer-server queuing system, including dynamic service times and key metrics like average wait time and dropouts.
My Contribution: Implemented event-driven simulation logic, state-based transitions, and statistics computation.
Technologies: Java, functional programming constructs.

### Email Reminder Automation
Branch: email-reminder-automation
Description: Automates quarterly email alerts for data updates, integrating with Outlook to send deadline-based reminders.
My Contribution: Developed email scheduling logic, Outlook integration, and dynamic email templating.
Technologies: Python, win32com.client, openpyxl.

### Report Generation Automation
Branch: report-generation-automation
Description: Automates the creation and updating of performance reports from Excel-based data, handling deadlines and metrics.
My Contribution: Designed logic for dynamic date handling, Excel sheet operations, and formula calculations.
Technologies: Python, openpyxl.

### Portfolio Optimization with Soybean and Wheat Futures
Branch: portfolio-modeling-soy-wheat
Description: Constructs an efficient frontier from soybean and wheat futures data using expected return and volatility. Identifies the minimum variance portfolio.
My Contribution: Built expected return models, volatility bands, MVP weights, and visualized the efficient frontier.
Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

### Multi-Factor Regression Model on Stock Returns
Branch: factor-regression-model
Description: Performs multi-factor regression using OLS to analyze stock returns against common risk factors and visualize beta exposures.
My Contribution: Engineered regression framework and built comparative plots for factor sensitivity across stocks.
Technologies: Python, Pandas, statsmodels, Matplotlib.

### 5-Asset Efficient Frontier and Minimum Variance Portfolio
Branch: efficient-frontier-optimization
Description: Optimizes a five-asset portfolio using historical return data. Uses numerical optimization to minimize volatility and simulate the efficient frontier.
My Contribution: Cleaned data, implemented optimization using scipy.optimize, simulated portfolios, and visualized the MVP.
Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy.

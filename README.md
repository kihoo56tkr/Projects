# TKR's Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of my personal and academic projects, showcasing my work in areas such as machine learning and statistical computing. Each project is organized in a separate branch, making it easy to explore my different works.

Projects
The following projects are available as separate branches in this repository:

1. Brain Tumor Detection
Branch: Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-and-Impact
Description: This project focuses on detecting brain tumors in MRI scans using different deep learning methods. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
My Contribution: I was responsible for the development and implementation of the CNN for image classification.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib.

3. Bike Rental Prediction
Branch: Statistics-and-Statistical-Computing
Description: This individual project focuses on analyzing and building predictive models for bike rental data to forecast the daily count of rental bikes. The dataset contains features like temperature, humidity, season, weather conditions, and working day status, and the goal is to build a regression model to predict the number of bike rentals.
My Contribution: I handled the data exploration, transformation of response variables, and built multiple regression models to predict the daily bike rental count. I also conducted outlier removal, feature selection, and model evaluation to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
Technologies: R, lm (linear regression)
